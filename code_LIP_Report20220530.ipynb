      "After that, it was pretty much a bunch of eating and gambling. I had dinner at Okana where the master chef was my own private sushi chef for the evening. OMG, it was fantastic! He made an exquisite nigiri of toro tuna with crushed pepper, then torched it to sear it and added some fresh lemon juice. It melted in my mouth -- simply amazing. There were other great delights there as well but that one was outstanding., 1872\n",
      "It ended up being pretty nice being there alone. I was able to relax, hang out by the pool, go shoot pictures, read, and gamble on my own schedule. I think next time I'll go with friends though -- much more fun at the tables with people you know., 1882\n",
      "The Hilton did have a fireworks display and I was able to watch it from my hotel room. It's pretty cool when you zoom in., 1892\n",
      "At the age of 13, it seems pretty straightforward. Avoid drinking, drugs and sex, and you’ll be fine. Ask forgiveness as soon as a curse word slips through your lips, and you’re back on His good side. Gossiping is bad, unless it’s your Sunday school teacher talking to your mom about one of the other kids’ parents (then it’s just story telling)., 1902\n",
      "So I’m three years late to this party, and I’m pretty sure this comment will go unread altogether, lol. But I just finished watching Numm and I have too many random thoughts that need to be expressed somehow., 1912\n",
      "Our threads are always open and you will pretty much always find someone willing to discuss the would’ve and should’ve of a particular drama – welcome aboard!, 1922\n",
      "Thanks so much! I went back and listened to Sania Saeed’s comments on Numm. She’s clearly as frustrated and disappointed about it as we are. I wonder what happened though. Budget ran out? Writer and director didn’t get along? Who knows. The weird thing is that this show had real craft in certain subplots. For example, Mj’s hairpin is a pretty good McGuffin, showing up symbolically as and when needed. It’s a neat trick, and the writer and director pulled that off pretty well. But much of the plot was a disaster, and actually knowing the whole thing may have derailed for reasons other than poor writing is weirdly satisfying., 1932\n",
      "Bird activity was actually pretty high along the 50-yard stretch of the Santa Cruz River while Alan and I walked back and forth hoping to get good views of the wren. I had birded this spot last April with my friend Anthony Collerton (but missed the wren then), and on the very same power poles then was probably this very same Common Raven who seemed to be uttering what I would refer to as a “song.” Here's my recording of it:, 1942\n",
      "I've been pretty much steering clear of this Amalekite controversy thus far, as I did not want to open up yet another front in the jousting between Ben and me on the historicity of the OT (I personally do not believe that YHWH ever ordered the Israelites to massacre anybody - ever)., 1952\n",
      "After the spread of Christianity, slaughter, enslavement, and atrocity (unfortunately) continued pretty much as before. It still does today. But with this one critical, all-important difference - to behave so was now for the first time in history morally and officially unacceptable., 1962\n",
      "So as a matter of fact, the overwhelming majority of what WLC professes is on pretty safe ground, but the problem remains that it will forever lack authority. I can't rely on him., 1972\n",
      "Yeah, that's your mistake right there, Bob. Your interpretation of that whole passage needs to be understood in similar way to how you interpreted the passage instructing the destruction of the Amalekites. That whole New Testament is pretty much allegory, as it turns out. :), 1982\n",
      "Bam - I still have the purple Lambo. Taking it on the Gumball Rally around the world in eight days really fucked it up. The Dirty Sanchez dudes from England did a donut in Thailand without my knowledge and ripped the clutch, leaving me no reverse, first, or second gear. Then Cleveland put diesel in my car and that was a pretty penny to drain that. Right now, it's in the driveway, alive and well., 1992\n",
